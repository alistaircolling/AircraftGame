			<introText><![CDATA[With increasing challenges on manpower and budgets, the Commander of the Land Forces is struggling to meet his operational commitments.  The impact of these reductions has led to a drop in equipment availability which is now as low as 65%. Based on your knowledge and experience of logistic support, you have been brought in on a six year contract to recover the situation and ensure maximum equipment availability whilst meeting the affordability and manpower challenges.<br><br>To succeed, you will need to bring the Availability Levels up to at least 75% with a decreasing budget. You have been allocated an initial budget which you can spend on 6 different logistic levers.<br><br>The simulation will allow you 3 decision points to recover the situation and meet by the Land Commander’s operational and affordability challenges. Each attempt will represent 2 years and you will need to decide at the start of each round on how best to allocate your budget against the various support service options.<br><br>The contract is incentivised so you will be rewarded with bonus payments for meeting the availability target of 75% or above; however, if you fail to meet the target you will be faced with financial penalties.<br><br>Your success and final score will be calculated using a combination of the following success criteria:<br>
				
<br>•	Monthly cash flow   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•	 Remaining money in bank
